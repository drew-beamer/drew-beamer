# Hi there, I'm Drew Beamer üëã 

## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a student studying computer science at Davidson College, hoping to eventually go into web application development. I enjoy working on projects that involve React, and am working to continue acquanting myself with the Next.js framework. In my spare time, I love to birdwatch and have seen over 800 species globally. 

Feel free to browse through my repositories and if you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thanks for visiting!
