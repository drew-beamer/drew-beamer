### Hi there 👋
### I'm Drew. A computer science student looking to go into software development / data analytics.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on several projects for 'Cats Stats, a student organization at Davidson that provides data analytics to coaches of our athletic programs.
- 🏀 I'm a huge Davidson basketball fan and run a Twitter page about the team (@DavidsonDecoded).
- 👨‍💻 I'm familiar with several languages and technologies, including Java, Python, Javascript (including React.js), C, and HTML/CSS.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've seen over 750 species of birds worldwide.
