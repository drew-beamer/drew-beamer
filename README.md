### Hi there 👋

<!--
**drew-beamer/drew-beamer** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on several projects for 'Cats Stats, a student organization at Davidson that provides data analytics to coaches of our athletic programs.
- 👨‍💻 I'm familiar with several languages and technologies, including Java, Python, Javascript (including React.js), C, and HTML/CSS.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've seen over 750 species of birds worldwide.
